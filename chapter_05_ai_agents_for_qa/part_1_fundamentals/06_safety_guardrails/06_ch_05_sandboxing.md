## 🎯 What is Sandboxing?

Running agents in isolated environments to prevent unintended damage.

---

## 🛡️ Sandboxing Strategies

### 1. Container Isolation
```dockerfile
# Run agent in Docker container
FROM python:3.11
RUN pip install agent-framework
# Limited network, no host access
```

### 2. Virtual Environment
```bash
# Separate Python environment
python -m venv agent_sandbox
source agent_sandbox/bin/activate
```

### 3. Database Isolation
```
Production DB ←── READ ONLY ── Agent
Test DB      ←── FULL ACCESS ── Agent
```

### 4. Network Restrictions
```yaml
# Allow only specific domains
allowed_domains:
  - api.jira.com
  - api.slack.com
  - staging.myapp.com
blocked:
  - production.myapp.com
```
